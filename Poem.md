what you suppose to do to meet a Mermaid ?you go to bottom of the sea,the water is even blue any more.the sky are only memories,and you foot there at silence.and you stay there and you decide to choose death for them.only these came out ，they come ,they greet you,judge the love you have for them.if it’s sincerely,if it’s pure,they will be with you and take you away forever.
